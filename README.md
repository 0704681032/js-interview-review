# What Do I Need to Know to Ace a JavaScript Interview?

Often there are threads posted around the internet about how to answer the top 10 gotcha JavaScript developer interview questions. Studying these the day before an interview is pointless like pulling an all-nighter studying for the SATs in 10th grade. We know what we know and these test measure the culmination over the years of that knowledge. Nonetheless, I'm putting gether a resource for review that covers some of the important concepts a JavaScript developer should know.

I'm reviewing material I have in my bookmark manager and listing them here as I do.
